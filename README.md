# Rock-Paper-Scissors

The classic Rock Paper Scissors game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You play against the computer and the game will keep track of the score. This game has a responsive interface and will work with any screen size.

To play the game, download all files and open the index.HTML file.

A blog post explaining the code will be coming to my website soon
